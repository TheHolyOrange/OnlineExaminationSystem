# ExamEase Online Examinations System

The goal of this system is to develop a comprehensive and interactive online examination platform that supports both students and teachers. The application should allow an admin to set up a repository of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with options and answers. Teachers will create exams from the question repository and provide keywords for each question to track 
studentsâ€™ strengths and weaknesses in different subjects or topics. Students will be able to take the exams with a timer, view their results, and receive topic-specific feedback. The system will generate a rank list to display performance and provide insights into areas where students need 
improvement.
